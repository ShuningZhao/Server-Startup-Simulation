This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
setwd("D:/Documents/UNSW/COMP9334/Project/Submission/01.KS_Test")
arrival <- read.csv(file="arrival.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
Interarrival <- arrival$Interarrival
ks.test(Interarrival, "pexp", rate = 0.35)
```
```{r}
service <- read.csv(file="service.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
service_time <- service$Service
ks.test(service_time, "pgamma", 3, 1)
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
